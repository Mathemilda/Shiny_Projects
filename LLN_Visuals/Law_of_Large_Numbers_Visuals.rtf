Recall Law of Large Numbers: an average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and 
will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed. In addition distribution of the average will converge to 
a normal distribution curve. 
Here you can perform trials with different number of samples and working with different random values from 3 distributions.
